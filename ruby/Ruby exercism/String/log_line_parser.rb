Instructions
In this exercise you'll be processing log-lines.

Each log line is a string formatted as follows: "[<LEVEL>]: <MESSAGE>".

There are three different log levels:

INFO
WARNING
ERROR
You have three tasks, each of which will take a log line and ask you to do something with it. There are lots of ways to solve these tasks - 
choose your favourite methods from the examples above and see what you can come up with.

Task 1
Get message from a log line
Implement the LogLineParser#message method to return a log line's message:

LogLineParser.new('[ERROR]: Invalid operation').message
# => "Invalid operation"
Any leading or trailing white space should be removed:

LogLineParser.new("[WARNING]:  Disk almost full\r\n").message
# => "Disk almost full"

Task 2
Get log level from a log line
Implement the LogLineParser#log_level method to return a log line's log level, which should be returned in lowercase:

LogLineParser.new('[ERROR]: Invalid operation').log_level
# => "error"

Task 3
Reformat a log line
Implement the LogLineParser#reformat method that reformats the log line, putting the message first and the log level after it in parentheses:

LogLineParser.new('[INFO]: Operation completed').reformat
# => "Operation completed (info)"

class LogLineParser
  def initialize(line)
    @line = line
  end

  def message
    @message = @line.split(": ")[1].strip
  end

  def log_level
    @log_level = @line.split("]: ")[0].split("[")[1].downcase
  end

  def reformat
    @reformat = @line.split(": ")[1].strip + " " + "(" + @line.split("]: ")[0].split("[")[1].downcase + ")"
  end
